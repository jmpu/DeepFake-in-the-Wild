## Paper Abstract

AI-manipulated videos, commonly known as deepfakes, are an emerging problem. Recently, researchers in academia and industry have contributed several (self-created) benchmark deepfake datasets, and deepfake detection algorithms. However, little effort has gone towards understanding deepfake videos in the wild, leading to a limited understanding of the real-world applicability of research contributions in this space. Even if detection schemes are shown to perform well on existing datasets, it is unclear how well the methods generalize to real-world deepfakes. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we make the following contributions: First, we collect and present the largest dataset of deepfake videos in the wild, containing 1,869 videos from YouTube and Bilibili, and extract over 4.8M frames of content. Second, we present a comprehensive analysis of the growth patterns, popularity, creators, manipulation strategies, and production methods of deepfake content in the real-world. Third, we systematically evaluate existing defenses using our new dataset, and observe that they are not ready for deployment in the real-world. Fourth, we explore the potential for transfer learning schemes and competition-winning techniques to improve defenses.


## Dataset Statistics

| Datasets | #Videos  | #Frames | Total duration | Avg. Duration  |
| :----------: | :-: | :-: | :-----: | :-: |
| DF-W YouTube | 1062[^1] | 2.9M | 30h 1m 12s | 1m 42s |
| DF-W Bilibili | 807[^2] | 1.9M | 18h 48m 48s | 1m 24s |
| DF-W | 1869 | 4.8M | 48h 50m 00s | 1m 34s |

[^1]: As we mentioned in the paper, for 5 videos of DF-W YouTube (1,062 videos), no faces were detected by the face
detector. These 5 videos do not contribute to the detection evaluation results in the paper, and we choose not to release them.
[^2]: There are 2 videos with (.part) extension in the DF-W Bilibili datasets. Part of these 2 videos was corrupted due to technical issues while downloading. You may exclude them for your evaluation. 


To fairly evaluate the functionality of each step in a detection pipeline, e.g., extracting faces and detecting on per face, we choose to not split/post-process/modify these videos in any way. All the videos are in its original form. All the videos are published on YouTube and Bilibili and can be viewed by the public.

## A Note Regarding the DF-W Evaluation

The negative-class videos (real videos) for evaluating detection schemes on DF-W were sampled from real videos of 6 research community datasets studied in the paper. We proportionally sampled 1,864 real videos from each of the research community datasets to build a balanced dataset (Table 3 of the paper). In this GitHub repository, we only release deepfake videos that we collected from the wild. To build a two-class video dataset, you may either follow the same strategy (i.e., sample real videos from research community datasets), or curate your own negative-class videos.
